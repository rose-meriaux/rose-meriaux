### About my professional (borderline not) self:
- 🔬 I’m a project leader who likes to get to the base of things - like the code my team writes.
- 🎈 I'm enthusiastic and commited to whatever I set my mind to!
- ⚽️ I'm a team player and take great pride in seeing my team members happy and satisfied.
- 🎯 I always put humans first, and fight hard to get everybody (everybody, I insist) on an equal footing.


### About my chore self:
My pronouns are she/her, and I am a proud intersectional feminist.

❤️ A few things that I love
- Doodling, and going to the museum at night to draw the artwork of others.
- Makeovers of all kinds - I just love when things get better, in any way! 
- Singing all the time - if I'm singing while you're talking to me, please don't mind, I probably didn't even realize I was doing it cause I was focusing on what you were saying.
- Also: languages, poetry, second hand & vintage clothes & furniture, reading, gardening...

🙈 Things that make me uncomfortable 
- When the whole room claps together at the end of a play or any live performance.
- Feets.
