❤️ A few things that I love
- Doodling, and going to the museum at night to draw the artwork of others.
- Makeovers of all kinds - I just love when things get better, in any way! 
- Singing all the time - if I'm singing while you're talking to me, please don't mind, I probably didn't even realize I was doing it cause I was focusing on what you were saying.
- Also: languages, poetry, second hand & vintage clothes & furniture, reading...

🙈 Things that make me uncomfortable 
- Moving around in the dark. Not scared of the dark, as long as I'm staying still!
- When the whole room claps together at the end of a play or any live performance.
- Feet (I mean, gross).
